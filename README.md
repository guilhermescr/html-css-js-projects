# Pure Web Projects

Here you can find projects with HTML, CSS, and some with JS too.

## Solar System

I developed this project to engage the community and so that the developers could have an outstanding project for their portfolio.

- Vertical Mode
- Horizontal Mode

OBS: I'm also using the term "alignment" besides "mode", because I believe it makes more sense in the solar system context.
